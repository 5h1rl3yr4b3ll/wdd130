        <p>Hi! My name is Shirley, and I'm from Mexico City.
            I'm an Actuary, and right now I work as a risk analyst in a government institution.
            In my free time, I love making amigurumis (cute crochet dolls), watching Korean series, reading, and, of
            course,
            enjoying Mexican food (tacos, pambazos, pozole, panuchos they're the best ❤️).
            I'm also studying Software Development at BYU Pathway, and I'm super excited for this term. Can't wait to
            learn how to
            build cool web pages 🤩</p>
