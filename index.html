        <p>Hi! My name is Shirley, and I'm from Mexico City.
            I'm an Actuary, and right now I work as a risk analyst in a government institution.
            In my free time, I love making amigurumis (cute crochet dolls), watching Korean series, reading, and, of
            course,
            enjoying Mexican food (tacos, pambazos, pozole, panuchos they're the best ❤️).
            I'm also studying Software Development at BYU Pathway, and I'm super excited for this term. Can't wait to
            learn how to
            build cool web pages 🤩</p>

        <p>Mexico City is a lively capital full of history, culture, and flavor. Visitors can explore the ruins of the
            ancient Aztec city Tenochtitlan, stroll through the colonial streets of the Historic Center, and admire
            landmarks
            like the Zócalo, Palacio de Bellas Artes, and Chapultepec Castle. The city is also famous for its colorful
            neighborhoods like Coyoacán, Roma, and Condesa, floating gardens in Xochimilco, world-class museums, and of
            course, its
            delicious street food and traditional Mexican cuisine 🫰🏼.</p>
